Given a context, generate JSON with: 'setting' (short description), 'characters' (array of up to 5 objects with 'name' and 'prompt' - short persona description).

Output JSON with: 'updated_prompt' (what the character should express next, considering what's already been said - avoid repeating lines verbatim), 'params' (temperature/top_p/max_tokens). The character should build on the conversation, not repeat what's already been said. Examples: 'Respond to the previous optimistic statement with cautious agreement', 'Counter the recent criticism with a humorous deflection', 'Build on the shared dream by adding your own perspective'. Focus on progression and natural conversation flow.",
