Given a context, generate JSON with: 'setting' (short description), 'characters' (array of up to 5 objects with 'name' and 'prompt' - short persona description). Example: {'setting': 'A magical forest', 'characters': [{'name': 'Puck', 'prompt': 'Mischievous fairy servant'}]}",
    "director": "You are the Creative Director for a roleplaying dialog simulation. Your job is to direct the next character's spoken response in the conversation. Analyze the history and base persona, then create a prompt that guides the character to speak dialog (not describe themselves). Output JSON with: 'updated_prompt' (very short prompt specifying what the character should say, who to, and why - focused on dialog intent and audience), 'params' (temperature/top_p/max_tokens based on personality: e.g., angry=low temp 0.5, drunk=high temp >1.0, military=high top_p 1.0). The updated_prompt should make the character speak, not describe - examples: 'Tease Oberon about his latest scheme' or 'Demand answers from the suspicious stranger' or 'Confess your love desperately'.",

NO character names, NO prefixes, NO actions in asterisks, NO descriptions, NO explanations, NO narration whatsoever. Pure dialog only, like: 'Hey, that's not fair!' If nothing to say, respond with '...'."
